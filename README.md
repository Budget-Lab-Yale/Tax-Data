# Tax-Data
Produces historical and projected tax microdata files 

## Outstanding tasks
As we focus on building a usable PUF for Budget Lab launch products, we are tabling several nice-but-not-strictly-necessary features for future versions. These include:  
- Unpacking aggregate return
- Projecting censored TCJA variables for targets
- Running the LP targeting algorithm for projected years
